 Installation

 1. Download Python:

```
Make sure you have Python installed 3.11+ and it is added to your path
```
 2. Download The Files:

```
Once you've downloaded the files extract the folder so it's no longer a .zip file.
```
 3. Open The setup.bat File:
```
Opening the setup.bat file will install all the necessary pip's from requirements.txt.

```
4. Open Stuxnet.py

```
Opening Stuxnet.py should close your browser and microsofts automatic sample submission. This is so that the grabber will not be seen by microsoft and report the code as unsafe. 
```
 5. Open the builder:

```
Open the builder on windows by going to your command prompt finding the directory "Stuxnet-Discord-Grabber-Main" and running the command "python builder.pyw"
You do not need to use any pip install commands as opening the setup.bat already installed everything required.

```
 6. Create A Webhook:

```
This webhook will be sent any victims you log so don't delete it once it's made. Once you've created one paste it
into the box which asks for your webhook.
```
 7. Configurable Options:

```
Now once you've done that you can tick on the options that you want enabled and anything you don't understand you can go 
to the documentation where each option is explained.
```
 8. What Now?

```
the .exe will now be in the same folder with the builder. Enjoy!
